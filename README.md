# jQuery DateTimePicker Plugin

A jQuery plugin to allow users to select a date and time without additional library requirements.

## Requirements

jQuery (Tested on v3.1.1)

datetimepicker.js

datetimepicker.css

## Functionality

Creates a button for users to click, which shows a picker dropdown from which they can select date(s) and time(s). The selected dates and times are then displayed on the button. Hidden inputs are produced with the date and time values selected, to be easily submit with HTML forms as normal.

Users can click between Months and then select date(s). For times, the user can either use the time spinner buttons, or they can click on the time and manually enter one, which will be validated.

## Setup

Include the necessary files stated in **Requirements** i.e.
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/jquery-latest.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/datetimepicker.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/datetimepicker.css">
```

It can be setup on any regular HTML DOM element, e.g. div, article, section etc. Initialise the element with the following:
```
$(document).ready(function(){
  $('#myElement').dateTimePicker();
})
```
et voil√†! You're all set to go. By default, it will only let the users pick a single date from 'today' onwards. There are a number of options you can change though:

### Options

To add an option to your DateTimePicker, simply include it in the initialisation as follows:
```
$(document).ready(function(){
  $('#myElement').dateTimePicker({ optionName: value(s) });
})
```

## Outputs
Creates `<input type="hidden">` elements within the DateTimePicker. So long as you include the initialised DateTimePicker element within your form, these will be sent to the server. If no values are selected, no inputs are created or sent to the server. 

The inputs will have the following names/values *(where the **DateTimePicker** prefix will be the value selected from the inputName parameter as detailed above )*

| Name/ID    | Description   | Value  |
| ------------- |:--------------:|:-----------------:|
| DateTimePicker-count | The number of dates selected | Integer |
| DateTimePicker-date-X | Where **X** is the incrementation of the count number, i.e. if this is the first date X = 0, second date X = 1 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| DateTimePicker-time | The time selected by the user | HH:MM |
